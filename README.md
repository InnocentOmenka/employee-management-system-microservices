# Employee Management System (Microservices Architecture)

This project is a RESTful Employee Management System built using Spring Boot microservices.  
It demonstrates a complete HR platform with authentication, service discovery, centralized configuration, and routing through an API Gateway.

## üèóÔ∏è Microservices Included
1. **Discovery Service** ‚Äì Eureka Server for service registration and discovery (port 8761).
2. **Config Server** ‚Äì Centralized configuration management for all services (port 8888).
3. **API Gateway** - Request routing, security, and Swagger UI aggregation (port 8080)
4. **Auth Service** ‚Äì Handles authentication, JWT generation, and role-based access (port 8081).
5. **Employee Management Service** ‚Äì CRUD operations and manages employees and departments (port 8082).

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements
- **Java 17+**
- **Maven 3.8+**
- **PostgreSQL 14+**
- **IntelliJ IDEA
- **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka**
- **Spring Cloud Config**
- **Docker (optional)**

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.2.0 + Spring Cloud 2023.0.0
- **Discovery**: Netflix Eureka
- **Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Config**: Spring Cloud Config Server
- **Security**: Spring Security + JWT
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Flyway + JPA/Hibernate
- **Documentation**: Springdoc OpenAPI 3
- **Build**: Maven
- **Java**: 17

## Prerequisites

- **Java 17+** (OpenJDK recommended)
- **Maven 3.8+**
- **PostgreSQL 13+** (port 5432, database: `employee_db`)
- **Git** (for future Git-based config)

## Setup Instructions


### 1. Database Setup & Initial Seeding

1. **Start PostgreSQL** and create database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE employee_db;
First Run - Automatic Admin Seeding:

2. When Auth Service starts for the first time, the UserSeeder automatically creates:

   -Email: admin@company.com
   -Password: Admin@123
   -Role: ADMIN


This admin user is only created once (checks for existing email)
Subsequent runs: Seeder skips if admin exists (logs "Admin user already exists")


User Hierarchy:

ADMIN (auto-seeded): Can create MANAGERS and EMPLOYEES.
MANAGER: Created by ADMIN, can manage department employees.
EMPLOYEE: Created by ADMIN, read-only access.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project (Local)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/InnocentOmenka/employee-management-system-microservices.git
   cd employee-management-service

**Start Services (Sequential Order)**
   Step 1: Start Discovery Service (Eureka)
   Step 2: Start Config Server
   Step 3: Update Microservices for Config Client
        For each service (auth-service, employee-management-service, api-gateway): Add Config Client dependency to pom.xml

<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
</dependency>


   Step 4: Start Auth Service
   Step 5: Start Employee Management Service



API Endpoints
Base URLs

Gateway: http://localhost:8080
Auth Service: http://localhost:8080/auth/**
Employee Service: http://localhost:8080/employee/**

Authentication Service Endpoints
Login (Public)

POST /auth/api/v1/auth/login
Request:
{
"email": "admin@company.com",
"password": "Admin@123"
}

Response:
{
"status": "success",
"message": "Login successful",
"data": {
"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
"user": {
"id": 1,
"email": "admin@company.com",
"role": "ADMIN"
}
}
}

Register (Public)

POST /auth/api/v1/auth/register
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Request:
{
"firstName": "John",
"lastName": "Doe",
"email": "john@company.com",
"password": "Password123",
"role": "EMPLOYEE",
"departmentId": 1
}


Employee Management Service Endpoints
(All require Authorization: Bearer <token>)
Get All Employees (ADMIN/MANAGER)

GET /employee/api/v1/employees

Get Employee by ID (All roles)

GET /employee/api/v1/employees/{id}

Create Employee (ADMIN)

POST /employee/api/v1/employees
Request:
{
"firstName": "Alice",
"lastName": "Green",
"email": "alice@company.com",
"role": "EMPLOYEE",
"departmentId": 1
}


**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

ADMIN: Full CRUD on employees/departments
MANAGER: Read employees in their department
EMPLOYEE: Read-only access to own data

JWT tokens include role claim for authorization.

**Department-Manager Assignment**
Key Feature: Managers are assigned to specific departments, enabling department-scoped access control.

Create Department (ADMIN only)
Create Manager User (via Auth Service, ADMIN only)
Assign Manager to Department (ADMIN only)
Manager Access: Can only view employees in their assigned department


#### **Direct Service Swagger UI Access**

### **Individual Service Swagger UIs**

Each microservice exposes its own **Swagger UI** directly on its service port:

- **Auth Service Swagger UI**:  
  **`http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html`**  
  üìã **Endpoints**: Authentication, login, user registration, JWT generation

- **Employee Management Service Swagger UI**:  
  **`http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui/index.html`**  
  üìã **Endpoints**: Employee CRUD, department management, manager assignments

### **Access Instructions**

1. **Start all services** following the sequential startup order
2. **Navigate directly** to each service's Swagger UI:
   - Auth: `http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html`
   - Employee: `http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui/index.html`
3. **Test endpoints** with proper JWT authorization:
   - Login via Auth Swagger UI ‚Üí Copy JWT token
   - Use token in Employee Swagger UI (Authorize button)

### **Direct Access Benefits**
- ‚úÖ **Service Isolation**: Test individual services independently
- ‚úÖ **Debugging**: Identify service-specific issues
- ‚úÖ **Development**: Direct endpoint testing without gateway
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Verification**: Check `springdoc` settings per service

### **Note on Direct Access**
- **CORS**: Services have individual CORS config (`spring.web.cors`)
- **JWT**: Tokens must be manually copied between services
- **Routing**: Bypasses API Gateway - use for development/debugging only
- **Production**: Use API Gateway (`http://localhost:8080`) for unified access

### **Service-Specific Testing Workflow**
1. **Auth Service** (`8081/swagger-ui`):
   - Login with `admin@company.com` / `Admin@123`
   - Create managers/employees
   - Copy JWT token
   
2. **Employee Service** (`8082/swagger-ui`):
   - Authorize with JWT from Auth Service
   - Test department creation and manager assignment
   - Verify RBAC and department scoping

**No aggregated Swagger UI available** - each service maintains its own OpenAPI documentation and Swagger interface.

Add this section to your **"API Endpoints"** or **"Testing"** section. This clarifies that there's **no gateway aggregation** and users should access Swagger UI directly on each service port.
